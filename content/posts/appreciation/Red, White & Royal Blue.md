The mere sight of the trailer immediately kindled a fervent anticipation for this film! It's released at the same time as the Barbie the movie in Japan. Had the notion of watching it yesterday alongside, but fatigue got the best of me. 

Today, with pink popcorn in hand, I finally settled in to watch and was not disappointed. Gotta say, I'm digging it! It lived up to my expectations and the waiting endured, akin to a whimsical fairy tale, truly unadulterated romance. Those female characters are endowed with abundance, amiability, and charisma. 

Ah, when might I truly inhabit the society they depict? A wholehearted recommendation to all, it tops my list for flicks this year. Unpretentious, soothing, and indeed, a balm for the soul!

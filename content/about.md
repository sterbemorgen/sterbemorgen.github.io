# welcome to my world
Hark! Friends and strangers, welcome to my world.<br> 
This, my new clandestine lair, is where I document my observations of mankind.<br> 
I'll take a cue from Константин Георгиевич Паустовский and say what's on my mind, even if it's been said before. As Bruno Schulz so eloquently stated, to retell stories that have already been heard.<br>
I shall not shy away from expressing ideas that may seem trivial or worn-out. But rather, strive to present the world as I perceive it through my own eyes.<br>

# mich

Khonzy<br>  
A whimsical being.<br> 
A vagabond by nature.<br>
Endowed with ASD, ADHD, and a profound tendency towards procrastination.
